                </a>
                is dedicated to helping cats and dogs permanent homes. Volunteers
                have the opportunity to spend the day taking care of these pets by
                feeding them, engaging in playtime, or going on walks. The
                experience is great because you get to give them affection until
                until they find other loving owners. I deeply value this
                organization because it allows you to form a bond with the
                animals, treating them as if they're your own, while contributing
                to their happiness and well-being. The sign up allows you to work
                with either cats or dogs, so they are open to both dog and cat
                lovers alike. The best part of the day is going in and finding out
                that another pet has been adopted.

                allows children around the world access to vital meals through
                donations and volunteer work. There are centers across the United
                States where volunteers crank music and diligently package boxes
                upon boxes of food. For those interested, it is an excellent
                experience especially with groups (as many hands makes the work go
                quick and keeps energy high). It is a highly fulfilling, fast
                paced way to spend a weekend with friends and family while making
                a difference. Time flew by incredibly quickly; the work was not
                monotonous, but rather a fun group experience battling global
                hunger.

                </a>
                Mission Arlington is a non-profit organization by my home town.
                Volunteers play a crucial role bringing food, toys, clothing, and
                other needed items to be sorted and distributed to the community.
                After sorting, items are given to families in need. One of my
                favorite aspects of volunteering at Mission Arlington was handling
                books and toys to be given to the younger kids. Additionally,
                greeting donors who bring items in their cars was a excellent way
                to meet people in the community. As a more local organization, it
                felt more intimate and personal learning peoples' names. If you're
                in the area, I highly recommend taking the time to donate your
                time or extra possessions.
